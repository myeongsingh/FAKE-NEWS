Project Workflow
1. Environment Setup
Install Required Libraries: Ensure that all necessary Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are installed in your environment using pip.
Prepare the Dataset: Obtain and place the fakerealnews.csv file in your working directory.
2. Data Loading and Exploration
Load Dataset: Use pandas to load the fakerealnews.csv file.
Explore Data: Print the first few rows using data.head() to understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Handle Missing Values: Replace any missing values with empty strings using data.fillna("").
3. Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection: Extract the title column as the feature (x) and the label column as the target variable (y).
Text Vectorization: Use CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the text data (news titles) into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning.
4. Data Splitting
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). Typically, 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing.
5. Model Training
Initialize Model: Create an instance of the MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) model.
Train Model: Fit the model on the training data using model.fit(xtrain, ytrain).
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate Accuracy: Use the model.score(xtest, ytest) function to evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data and print the result.
7. Making Predictions
Predict News Headline: Input a new news headline to test the model's prediction capability.
Transform Input: Convert the input headline into a numerical format using cv.transform() to match the model's input format.
Output Prediction: Use model.predict() to determine whether the headline is classified as "FAKE" or "REAL" and print the result.
8. Continuous Improvement
Model Tuning: Consider fine-tuning the model by adjusting hyperparameters or using more sophisticated preprocessing techniques like TF-IDF.
Data Expansion: Improve the model's performance by incorporating a larger and more diverse dataset, or by adding more features like article text or metadata.
