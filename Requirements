 **Project Requirements**

To successfully run the Fake News Detection project using a Naive Bayes classifier, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

 **1. Python Environment**
- **Python Version**: 3.6 or higher

 **2. Required Libraries**
Install the following Python libraries, which are essential for data processing, model building, and prediction:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, and utilities for data splitting and vectorization.

You can install all the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

 **3. Dataset**
- **fakerealnews.csv**: The project requires a dataset in CSV format, where news articles are labeled as either "FAKE" or "REAL." This dataset should include columns such as `title`, `text`, and `label`. Ensure that the CSV file is properly formatted and accessible.

**4. Hardware Requirements**
- Basic hardware (CPU) is sufficient for running this model due to its relatively lightweight computation requirements. 
- At least 4GB of RAM is recommended to handle data processing and model training tasks.

 **5. Software/Tools**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional): If you prefer running the code interactively in a notebook environment.
