Fake News Detection model using Naive Bayes technique

This project is regarding Fake News Detection using Niave Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks like fake news detection. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a label given certain features. The "naive" part comes from the assumption that all features (in this case, words in the article) are independent of each other, which simplifies computation.

In a fake news detection context, the model is trained on a dataset where news articles are labeled as either "fake" or "real." The features are typically the words in the articles, and the model learns the likelihood of these words appearing in each class (fake or real). Once trained, the model can classify new, unseen articles by calculating the probability of each class based on the words present and assigning the label with the highest probability.

Despite its simplicity, the Naive Bayes classifier is effective for text classification tasks and can be a powerful tool in detecting fake news.
